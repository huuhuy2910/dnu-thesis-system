This folder holds images and diagrams referenced in the root README.

Place your files here with these suggested names:

- dnu_logo.png
- fitdnu_logo.png
- aiotlab_logo.png
- architecture.png
- screen-admin-dashboard.png
- screen-committee-wizard.png
- screen-student-schedule.png
- screen-lecturer-committees.png

Notes:
- Use PNG or SVG. Keep widths under ~1600px so they render well on GitHub.
- If you rename files, update the root README links accordingly.
- For architecture, you can export from draw.io/diagrams.net as PNG and name it `architecture.png`.
